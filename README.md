# Linux-Security-Audit
PROJECT GOAL :

The objective of the project is to perform a structural security audit of a linux server reviewing user access, file permissions,and running processes to identify common misconfigurations that can lead to security breaches.

SCOPE :

This audit focuses on the following areas:

1. User accounts and privilaged(sudo) access.
2. File and directory permission configurations.
3. Active processes and system services.

The goal is to understand how misconfiguration in these areas increase the system's attack surface.

APPROACH :

A structured security review was performed by examining user access, file permissions, and system visibility to uncover common security misconfigurations.

Findings were documented based on security impact, potential exploitation scenarios, and best-practice violations.

Technical commands used for validation are documented separately and kept minimal to maintain clarity .


OUTCOME :

This audit demonstrates how basic Linux misconfigurations can be leveraged for privilege escalation, data exposure, or persistence by attackers.
It reflects a practical security mindset aligned with real-world system administration and defensive security roles.
